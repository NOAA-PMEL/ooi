bill, i have some good progress. I have converted your jupyter notebook to straight anaconda python and it runs on caldera. The script takes about 3 1/2 minutes to complete and uses little CPU.

Next steps:
. use current time or supplied start date/time, optional end date/time
. detect errors
. run from cron
. combine 15min files into daily files useful to andy
. report errors via email
. method to retry and renew missing data, manual and automatic
