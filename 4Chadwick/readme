Attached is the file: RSN-IDLfiles.Info showing what output files: *.idl
& *.png generated and used by which IDL programs (the *.pro).  It also
shows other status files such as LastProcessedFileName.MJ03? ,
LastProcessedCTD.FileName and UpLiftAlertStatus.MJ03? used by some of
the IDL programs.

At the end of the RSN-IDLfiles.Info  It shows the Orders of the RSN and
CTD data processing.

The data directory structure is following:
/home/lau/4Chadwick/RSN/   and it has 3 subdirectories:  MJ03B/, MJ03D/,
...,  MJ03F/.
Each one of the subdirectories contains the IDL save files ( e.g.
MJ03B1HrAveLILY.idl),
status files (e.g. LILY-XtiltAlertStatus.MJ03B &
LastProcessedFileName.MJ03B)
and graphic files (e.g. MJ03B25Apr2015onIRIS.png)
All these files will be updated either every 15 minutes or once a day.

At the main directory: /home/lau/4Chadwick/RSN/, there are tidal cycle
data stored in the IDL save files.  The current ones being used are
Dec2018-2019AxialTidalDataMJ03[B/D/E/F].idl by the program:
ProcessRSNdata.pro in the procedure: DETIDE_NANO_DATA.  In mid-December
this year, the new files: Dec2019-2020AxialTidalDataMJ03[B/D/E/F].idl 
need to be used.

Also in the directory: /home/lau/4Chadwick/RSN/ are the IDL programs for
processing the RSN and CTD data.  One of them is the
RunPrintRSNdata2Files.pro which shows the steps for printing out the
NANO or LILY data by specify the time range into a text file.

Another file: RunGetRates2Start.pro, shows the steps for relevelling the
tilt data from beginning to the end of the available data.
