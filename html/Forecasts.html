      <h1>Inflation Threshold Forecasts - Method #1</h1>
      <p><br />
        The plots below use the <strong><a href="rates.html">average inflation rate calculated from the last 12 weeks of de-tided depths</a></strong> from instrument MJ03F to the calculate the time when Axial Seamount will reach: (1) the level of inflation when the 2015 eruption started, and (2) a level of inflation 30 cm higher than in 2015 (which is somewhat arbitrary, but is included because the  level of inflation in 2015 was 30 cm higher than the level reached before the 2011  eruption).&nbsp; These plots are updated once a day using the latest data from the OOI Cabled Array. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: this <strong>Forecasting - Method #1</strong> is relatively "noisy" because the de-tided BPR depths include tidal residuals and oceanographic effects in addition to the geophysical signals we are interested in.  (See the <a href="Forecasts2.html"><strong>Forecasting - Method #2</strong></a> and <a href="Forecasts3.html"><strong>Forecasting - Method #3</strong></a> pages for other methods that are probably <strong>better</strong>). In any case, the 12-week rate of inflation is quite variable and so the forecast dates will also be quite variable. &nbsp;The histogram plot below shows the dates where most of the forecasts have fallen. &nbsp;When the 12-week inflation rate gets very low, forecasts are suspended until the rate returns to higher levels. &nbsp;Of course, we do not know at exactly what level of inflation the next eruption at Axial will be triggered, but our best guess is that it will be within a year after the 2015 inflation threshold is  reached.&nbsp; We will likely make a more  specific forecast when we get closer to that threshold on our Axial Seamount <a href="../axial_blog.html"><strong>Eruption Forecast Blog</strong></a>.

      <p>Plot of OOI BPR data from the Caldera Center (BOTPT-A301-MJ03F; black curve) showing deflation during the 2015 eruption (left) followed by re-inflation.  If the rate is positive, a blue dashed line  extrapolates into the future using the average rate of inflation from the last  12 weeks; middle blue dot is date when 2015 inflation threshold is reached,  right purple dot is when a threshold 30 cm higher will be reached.

      <p>Histogram of predicted dates when Axial Seamount will reach the 2015 threshold, color coded by when the predicted date was  calculated.  Predicted dates were  calculated based on the average rate of reinflation from the previous 12-weeks,  beginning in June 2015.  Note right after  the 2015 eruption (purple) when the inflation rate was highest, the predicted  dates were earliest.  In contrast, the  orange bars on the right side of the histogram were all predicted during the  latter half of 2017 when the inflation rates were particularly low.  Many latest predictions (red) are in the  2020-2022 neighborhood.  Predicted dates  are binned in months.  Click for a larger version this plot.

      <p>Plot of Predicted date that inflation will reach the 2015 inflation threshold (Y-axis) vs. Date on which the prediction was made  (X-axis), using the average rate of inflation from the previous 12 weeks,  starting in June 2015.  Blue dots are date to reach the 2015 inflation threshold; purple dots are for a threshold 30 cm higher (as in the first plot above). Note predicted  dates were earliest when the rate of re-inflation was highest, soon after the  2015 eruption (left side of plot).  Peaks in the   curves show time periods when the average rate of inflation slowed significantly  (especially in mid-2017 and mid-2018), which pushed the predicted dates farther into the  future.  Click for a larger version this plot.
