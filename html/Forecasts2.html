      <h1>Inflation Threshold Forecasts - Method #2 (last 1 month)</h1>
      <p><br />
        This is a second alternative method of forecasting  the time when Axial Seamount will reach the inflation level before the 2015 eruption started. We  found that  <strong><a href="Forecasts.html">Forecasting - Method #1</a></strong> was quite &quot;noisy&quot; because the de-tided BPR depths include tidal residuals and oceanographic effects in addition to the geophysical signals we are interested in. <strong>In contrast, this Forecasting - Method #2</strong> subtracts the de-tided depths from  BPR MJ03E (Eastern Caldera, which has the smallest inflation signals) from BPR MJ03F (Central Caldera, which has the largest inflation signals), and uses the <a href="diffs.html"><strong>DEPTH DIFFERENCES</strong></a> between the two to calculate a differential inflation rate for the last <strong>4 weeks</strong>. This  removes the tidal residuals and oceanographic effects that are common to both stations. <strong>Method #2</strong> calculates the differential inflation rate for the last <strong>4-weeks</strong> and uses it to extrapolate into the future to when the differential level of inflation will reach: (1) the level when the 2015 eruption started, and (2) a  level   20 cm higher than in 2015 (which is somewhat arbitrary, but is included because the  level of inflation in 2015 was  higher than the level reached before the 2011  eruption).&nbsp; These plots are updated once a day using the latest data from the OOI Cabled Array.      In contrast, <a href="Forecasts3.html"><strong>Forecasting - Method #3</strong></a> calculates the differential inflation rate for the last <strong>12-weeks</strong> to extrapolate into the future.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: the  rate of inflation is  variable and so the forecast dates will also vary with time. &nbsp;The histogram plot below shows the dates where most of the forecasts have fallen. &nbsp;When the 4-week inflation rate gets very low, forecasts are suspended until the rate returns to higher levels. &nbsp;Of course, we do not know at exactly what level of inflation the next eruption at Axial will be triggered, but our best guess is that it will be within a year after the 2015 inflation threshold is  reached.&nbsp; We will likely make a more  specific forecast when we get closer to that threshold on our Axial Seamount <a href="../axial_blog.html"><strong>Eruption Forecast Blog</strong></a>.

      <p>Histogram of predicted dates when Axial Seamount  will reach the 2015 <strong>differential inflation </strong>threshold, color coded by when the predicted date was  calculated.  Predicted dates were  calculated based on the average rate of <strong>differential</strong> inflation from the previous 4-weeks,  beginning in June 2015.  Predicted dates  are binned in months.  Click for a larger version this plot.</p>

      <p>Plot of Predicted date that <strong>differential</strong> inflation will reach the 2015  inflation threshold (Y-axis) vs. Date on which the prediction was made  (X-axis), using the average rate of <strong>differential</strong> inflation from the previous 4 weeks,  starting in June 2015.  Blue dots are date to reach the 2015 inflation threshold; purple dots are for a threshold 20 cm higher (as in the first plot above). Note predicted  dates were earliest when the rate of re-inflation was highest, soon after the  2015 eruption (left side of plot).  Peaks in the   curves show time periods when the average rate of inflation slowed significantly  (especially in mid-2017 and mid-2018), which pushed the predicted dates farther into the  future.  Click for a larger version this plot.
