      <h1>Inflation Threshold Forecasts - Method #3 (last 3 months)</h1>
      <p><br />
        This is a third alternative method of forecasting  the time when Axial Seamount will reach the inflation level reached before the 2015 eruption started. We have found that  <strong><a href="Forecasts.html">Forecasting - Method #1</a></strong> and <a href="Forecasts2.html"><strong>Forecasting - Method #2</strong></a> have not been ideal, so we are trying a third. Method #1 is  &quot;noisy&quot; because the de-tided BPR depths include tidal residuals and oceanographic effects; it uses an average rate of uplift from the last <strong>12 weeks</strong>. In contrast,  Method #2  uses  <a href="diffs.html"><strong>DEPTH DIFFERENCES</strong></a> between  two stations (removing the source of noise in #1) to calculate a differential inflation rate; it used an average rate of uplift from the last <strong>4 weeks</strong>.  This was better, but the time-period for averaging the rate of uplift seems to be too short, so in <strong>Forecasting - Method #3</strong>, we are averaging the rate of uplift over the last <strong>12 weeks</strong>. Hopefully that will give us the best of both worlds. We use the average inflation rate for the last <strong>12-weeks</strong> (shown on the <a href="Forecasts2.html"><strong>Forecasting - Method #2</strong></a> page) to extrapolate into the future to when the differential level of inflation will reach: (1) the level when the 2015 eruption started, and (2) a  level   20 cm higher than in 2015 (which is somewhat arbitrary, but is included because the  level of inflation in 2015 was  higher than the level reached before the 2011  eruption).&nbsp; These plots are updated once a day using the latest data from the OOI Cabled Array. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: the  rate of inflation is  variable and so the forecast dates will also vary with time. &nbsp;The histogram plot below shows the dates where most of the forecasts have fallen. &nbsp;When the 12-week inflation rate gets very low, forecasts are suspended until the rate returns to higher levels. &nbsp;Of course, we do not know at exactly what level of inflation the next eruption at Axial will be triggered, but our best guess is that it will be within a year after the 2015 inflation threshold is  reached.&nbsp; We will likely make a more  specific forecast when we get closer to that threshold on our Axial Seamount <a href="../axial_blog.html"><strong>Eruption Forecast Blog</strong></a>. &nbsp;Programing  by Andy Lau, Oregon State University.<br /></p>

      <p>Plot of OOI BPR data from the Caldera Center (BOTPT-A301-MJ03F; black curve) showing deflation during the 2015 eruption (left) followed by re-inflation.  If the rate is positive, a blue dashed line  extrapolates into the future using the average rate of inflation from the last  <strong>12 weeks</strong>; middle blue dot is date when 2015 inflation threshold is reached,  right purple dot is when a threshold 20 cm higher will be reached.

      <p>Histogram of predicted dates when Axial Seamount will reach the 2015 threshold, color coded by when the predicted date was  calculated.  Predicted dates were  calculated based on the average rate of reinflation from the previous <strong>12-weeks</strong>,  beginning in June 2015.  Predicted dates  are binned in months.  Click for a larger version this plot. </p>

      <p>Plot of Predicted date that inflation will reach the 2015 inflation threshold (Y-axis) vs. Date on which the prediction was made  (X-axis), using the average rate of inflation from the previous <strong>12 weeks</strong>,  starting in June 2015.  Blue dots are date to reach the 2015 inflation threshold; purple dots are for a threshold 20 cm higher (as in the first plot above). Note predicted  dates were earliest when the rate of re-inflation was highest, soon after the  2015 eruption (left side of plot).  Peaks in the   curves show time periods when the average rate of inflation slowed significantly  (especially in mid-2019), which pushed the predicted dates farther into the  future.  Click for a larger version this plot.
