      <h1>Long-Term Uplift Rates</h1>
<p><br />
  This page displays long-term rates of uplift or subsidence, calculated using data from the Bottom Pressure Recorders (NANO-BPR) on the BOTPT instruments at Axial Seamount, part of the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) Cabled Array seafloor observatory, operated by the University of Washington. The dates/times below are in GMT (+8 hrs  of local standard time, or +7 hrs  of  DLS time on the US west coast). Note the long-term rates were reset after the <a href="24April2015_event.html"><strong> April 2015 eruption.</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 12-week uplift rate from the Central Caldera (MJ03F, 1st plot below) is used on the <strong><a href="Forecasts.html">Forecasting - Method #1</a></strong> page. However, we have another forecasting method that is probably better on the <strong><a href="Forecasts2.html">Forecasting - Method #2</a></strong> page, which used the <a href="diffs.html"><strong>Rate of Differential Uplift</strong></a> between stations MJ03F and MJ03E. This removes the &quot;noise&quot; from tidal residuals and oceanographic effects and provides a clearer representation of the volcanic inflation signal.<br />

<h2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The plots below show the long-term rates of depth change, from each of the four BOTPT instruments, calculated from 1-day means of the de-tided NANO-BPR data over time.
