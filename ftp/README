figuring out a problem

.1 is our fetch running?
look at timestamp of download.log - should be within last 15min
 $chadwick@syspc$ ls -l /data/chadwick/4andy/download.log

.2 are we fetching?
look at time of most recent file in one dir, e.g. mj03f
note: this file is timestamped GMT, 7 or 8 hours earlier than us (pacific)

.3 are they updating?

.3.1 get ftp pwd
 $chadwick@syspc$ crontab -l

.3.2 ftp login, from syspc or a web browser
 $chadwick@syspc$ lftp noaa@ftp.ooirsn.uw.edu

.3.3 check file time, using date wildcard
 lftp noaa@ftp.ooirsn.uw.edu:/mj03f> cd mj03f
 lftp noaa@ftp.ooirsn.uw.edu:/mj03f> dir *20160713*
-rwxr--r--    1 134      110      10595525 Jul 13 02:23 BOTPTA301_10.31.6.5_9338_20160713T0000_UTC.dat

note: this file is timestamped GMT, 7 or 8 hours earlier than us (pacific)
